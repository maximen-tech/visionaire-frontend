## 💡 Key Learnings & Recommendations

### What Went Well
1. **Content-First Approach:** Generating all content before implementation ensured consistency
2. **Design System:** Creating reusable components first made homepage implementation fast
3. **Brand Voice Adherence:** Strict guidelines (CLAUDE.md) resulted in high-quality, consistent copy
4. **Build Quality:** No TypeScript or compilation errors on first build

### Recommendations for Week 2
1. **Prioritize Secondary Pages:** The content is ready, just needs React implementation
2. **SEO Critical:** Meta tags and structured data will significantly improve discoverability
3. **Accessibility Audit:** Run axe-core before deployment to catch issues early
4. **Performance Budget:** Monitor bundle size as pages are added (target: <150 kB First Load JS)
5. **Cookie Consent:** Implement before launch (GDPR requirement)
6. **User Testing:** Test with 2-3 real SMB leaders before full launch

### Potential Improvements
1. **Icon System:** Replace emojis with professional SVG icons (lucide-react)
2. **Hero Image:** Consider adding a visual element to hero section
3. **Animation:** Subtle entrance animations for sections (intersection observer)
4. **Testimonials:** Add real testimonials with photos (currently just example in content)
5. **A/B Testing:** Set up infrastructure to test hero variations
